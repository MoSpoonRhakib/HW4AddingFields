Response for HWK4 Question 1

For the "all_up" state, if a positive B field is applied, it is more likely the spins will align in the direction of B. This means that the spins will align with the up direction. If a strong magnetic field is applied to the "all_up" state, but it is negative, then the spin states are more likely to point doen. The stronger the field, the smaller the Curie temperature meaning that the ferromagnetic will reach M=0 at a lower temperature.

For the "all_down" state, the same behavior can be applied. Here, a strong positive field, will cause the spins to flip the opposite direction. If there is a small positive field then the spins are less likely to flip their spin states and will remain in the down position.

The external magnetic field and the mean field is competing against each other. Whichever is stronger, the spins will align in their favor.
